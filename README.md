# Welcome to the Advanced Team Dealership Project ðŸš—

In this repository you will find the code written in the Java language, this is a follow up of the original Car Dealership project that built a mini console-based application for a dealership. According to these instructions, the application additions are to be built with these specifications in mind:

A Sales and Leasing option is to be added to the original dealership menu. (e.g. SELL/LEASE A VEHICLE)

When the user inputs a sale or a lease, the application will be able to:
- Prompt the user with questions to collect basic sales information from the user
- Add the vehicle information to the contract file
- Ask the user if the transaction is a Sale or a Lease
- Calculate the pricing

# Screens
